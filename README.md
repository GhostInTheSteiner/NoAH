# NoAH

NoAH is a toolset around a script called "PyTextbox" which serves to animate text in in a Visual Novel esque way. As output it will deliver transparent .mov-videos, which can be used in any decent video editor. It mainly supports fading (left-to-right), appending multiple paragraphs and adjusting paragraph fade-in time to a voice track sample as core features while being highly configurable.

fun^10 x int^40 = Ir2 is an Autohotkey-Script to ease up editing in Kdenlive, by adding a few convenient shortcuts to e.g. easily fade-in or fade-out images.

[Even though GitHub is intended for source control I'll just abuse it right there as storage for a dummy setup, blame me if you want to ('_v')]
