# NoAH

NoAH is a toolset around a script called "PyTextbox" which serves to animate text in a Visual Novel esque way.
It mainly supports fading (left-to-right), appending multiple paragraphs and adjusting paragraph fade-in time to a voice track sample as core features while being highly configurable. Even though GitHub is intended for source control I'll just abuse it right there as storage for a dummy setup, blame me if you want to ('_v')
